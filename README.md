# ML-K-means-Clustering
In this assignment,we run K-Means algorithm on a credit card dataset.



Things to do :
 Read the credit_card_dataset.csv data, clean the data and normalise the features.
 Write a function which fits K-Means on the data for various values of K and plot the silhoutte score for all the different values of K. 
 Use the yellowbrick code to explore the elbow method to decide the optimal number of clusters. The code is already available in your notebook.By using the code !pip install yellowbrick to install this library in your kernel. 
 Compare different metrics for evaluation of the clustering such as $distortion$, $silhouette$ etc. and find out which performs the best clustering.
